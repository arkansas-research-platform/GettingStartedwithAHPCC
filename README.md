This repository is designed and produced for the first time users. The flow of the repository is organized to take the user from introducing the basics of Linux-based operating system to HPC resource management and job submission tools to help users submit their job. Provided examples are just added to show the required steps for each task to successfully submit the job to the HPC system.
